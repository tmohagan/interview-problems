/*
 * Maven is a powerful project management and build automation tool primarily used for Java projects.
 * It provides a standardized way to build, package, and manage dependencies for software projects.
 * Key features of Maven include:
 *   - Dependency Management: Automatically downloads and manages project dependencies.
 *   - Build Automation: Compiles source code, runs tests, and packages the application.
 *   - Project Structure: Enforces a standard project structure.
 *   - Project Information: Manages project documentation and reporting.
 *   - Lifecycle Management: Defines a standard build lifecycle (validate, compile, test, package, etc.).
 *
 * pom.xml (Project Object Model) and Maven:
 * - The pom.xml is an XML file that serves as the core of a project's configuration in Maven.
 * - It contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
 * - Key elements in pom.xml include:
 *   - Project Coordinates: groupId, artifactId, and version uniquely identify the project.
 *   - Dependencies: Libraries the project needs to compile, test, and run.
 *   - Build Settings: Plugins and their configurations for building the project.
 *   - Project Information: Name, description, developers, etc.
 *
 * Interaction with Java code:
 * - The pom.xml file doesn't directly interact with Java code (e.g., InterviewApplication.java).
 * - Instead, it sets up the environment and provides resources for the Java code to run.
 * - For example:
 *   - It specifies the Java version to use for compilation and runtime.
 *   - It defines dependencies such as Spring Boot libraries, making them available to the Java code.
 *
 * Maven's build process:
 * - When you run Maven commands like 'mvn compile' or 'mvn package':
 *   1. Maven reads the pom.xml file.
 *   2. It downloads specified dependencies from repositories if they're not already present.
 *   3. It compiles the code using the specified Java version.
 *   4. It makes libraries available, ensuring annotations like @SpringBootApplication 
 *      and classes like SpringApplication can be used in your code.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - This approach standardizes the build process, making it easier to build and maintain 
 *   Java projects across different environments.
 * - It ensures consistency in dependencies and build configurations across team members 
 *   and deployment environments.
 * - It simplifies the process of upgrading dependencies or changing build configurations.
 *
 * Best Practices:
 * - Keep the pom.xml file in version control along with your source code.
 * - Use properties in pom.xml to define versions, making it easier to update dependencies.
 * - Regularly update dependencies to get bug fixes and new features, but be cautious of breaking changes.
